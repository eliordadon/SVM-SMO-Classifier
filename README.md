# SVM-SMO-Classifier  
Python implementation of the SVM algorithm using Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO).  
  
## Requirements
The following libraries are required:  
  
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
  
_Use ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to auto install_   
  
## Additional Information  

- The ```svm_smo.py``` file contains the main logic for training a SVM model, and performing multi-class prediction.  
  
- The project try the implementation on the Iris Dataset in ```main.py```, you can change it.
